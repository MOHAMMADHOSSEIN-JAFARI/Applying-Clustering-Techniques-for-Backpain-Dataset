# Backpain-Spine-Clustering-and-Feature-Selection-
The Data set has 12 features. We run unsupervised learning techniques such as "Hierarchical Clustering", "K-means" and different linkage methods such as "average", "single", "complete" and "ward".
Then, we work on the methods for optimal number of clusters such as "Gap Statistic", "Elbow", and "Silhouette". 
By running PCA, we analyze the the data from the "feature viewpoints".
